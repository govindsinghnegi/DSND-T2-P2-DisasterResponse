# Disaster Response Project
This project is done as a requirement from Data Science Nano Degree, offered by 
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). 
As input, we have the real messages that were sent during disaster events. This has been
provided by [Figure Eight](https://appen.com). Goal of this project is to build a classification
model to categorize the messages so that they can then be sent to appropriate 
disaster relief agencies. 

The final project is a webapp that incorporates the classification model. In the webapp a
user can input a message and get classification results in several categories.

## Pre-requisites
```
python3
pandas
sklearn
numpy
flask
plotly
sqlalchemy
nltk
```

## Files
* app
    - template
        - go.html (classification-result page)
        - master.html (main page)
    - run.py (backend code that runs flask webapp)
* data
    - DisasterResponse.db (SQLite db generated by running ```process_data.py```)
    - disaster_categories.csv (message categories)
    - disaster_messages.csv (messages)
    - process_data.py (module for ETL)
* models
    - classifier.pkl (pickle file generated by running ```train_classifier.py```)
    - train_classifier.py (module perform NLP and ML operations)
* notebook (notebooks and their corresponding html used to generate the final 
python modules such as ```process_data.py``` and ```train_classifier.py```)
    - ETL_Pipeline_Preparation.html
    - ETL_Pipeline_Preparation.ipynb
    - ML_Pipeline_Preparation.html
    - ML_Pipeline_Preparation.ipynb

## Running the application
Please follow the following to run the application:
* At the root directory,
    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
    ``` python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db ```
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves 
    ``` python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl```
* Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app
    ``` python run.py```
* Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
